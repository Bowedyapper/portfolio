[**COORD**](https://beta.coord.uk) (Formerly [OSG2C](https://osg2c.uk)) is a progressive web app for iOS and Android made specifically for delivery drivers who need to be able to find obscure addresses quickly and easily, written in Typescript and Javascript and deployed using a custom Gitlab CI/CD runner to build a docker image and run in a container on the same server.

I created this app originally to make it easier finding coordinates for specific addresses for myself and my fellow Tesco colleagues as I noticed that it would be very time consuming for us to cross reference
